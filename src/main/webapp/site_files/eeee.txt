Subash we never implemented the real application to printer communication but relied on the print function of the browser.

so these are the steps
a) Customer places an Order
b) A background running ajax system which constantly polled the system for any new order finds out that a new order has been placed and pops up a message in restaurants dashboard.
c) restaurant personnel clicks the popup message and order detail page is opened then he clicks browser's print function to redirect the orders to the shared printer.

there is no push function from the server.its the pull type polling the determines of an order has been placed.


and for JNI

there was a hardware which was provided with a DLL file containing all the function calls to read data from the chip. we read the PDF. and developed a C program that called the DLL's function. this C program was written in MFC and visual studio and not turbo c compiler.

then we arote a java code that interfaced this C program from JNI interface.

the DLL was also written in c but i was having difficulty to directly call DLL's function from java code. so an intermediate C program was written to interface device's dll(which came in CD with device) which in turn exchanged data between device and Java program.


And if I send you a scanned copy of pragtek's letterpad, will you be able to write the text and send it back to me? i will sign and then return it back to you. And I am ok if you include ptek references in your resume.


and regarding that student, i have his FB link and i can send him a message. but it will be more effective if i communicate to him through the Principle. i can contact  him if the principle can acknowledge that i am contacting through him. ani i can see from his FB page that he is from class of 2014. may be he is still in 1st/2nd year. or i am not sure.
